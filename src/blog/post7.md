This past semester, I took [http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.301](6.301), a Solid-State Circuits course that focuses on transistors and their practical applications through labs. 

In this second post, I will cover my second laboratory project, for which I built a wideband amplifier using 4 BJTs. Using a 15V DC supply and 62.6mW of power, it achieved a midband gain of -165 with a lower -3dB bandwidth of 13kHz and an upper -3dB bandwidth of 7.1MHz.
