Hello! This is the start of my new blog, /usr/etc/rahul/*. I've been meaning to make a blog for over a year now, and I finally got around to making this.

I'm not entirely sure what I will be writing about, but it will most likely be a combination of notes on my experiences and projects, so expect to see a lot of tech-related content!
