Hi! Iâ€™m Rahul. I am a developer, aspiring engineer, and (amateur) musician. I am passionate about anything and everything relating to technology.

I am a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying Course 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). Check out my coursework below! In my free time, I direct DevOps for HackMIT and help run the MIT IEEE/ACM student chapter.

This summer, I am working as a Software Engineering Intern on the Infrastructure team at Quora!

I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, just a couple minutes away from the Johnson Space Center. I graduated from Clear Lake High School as Salutatorian of the Class of 2017 (see my speech here!). During my time in high school, I was invited to the White House Science Fair in 2015 and 2016. I also competed in the USA Math and Computing Olympiads. In addition, I was the principal cellist of the CLHS Orchestra and played in the Texas All State Orchestras (2015, 2016, 2017).

In my free time, I love reading just about any book I can get my hands on (but especially Harry Potter) and watching movies, both Bollywood and Hollywood. Some of my favorites include the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Team Iron Man!), Zootopia, and Sherlock. I also enjoy watching tennis (#RafaNadal) and YouTube tech reviewers.
