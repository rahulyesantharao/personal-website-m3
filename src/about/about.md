Hi! I’m Rahul. I'm a hardware engineer at [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com).

Previously, I completed my undergrad (BS) and master's (MEng) in EECS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During my time at MIT, I directed DevOps for [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org), helped run the [MIT IEEE/ACM](http://ieeeacm.mit.edu/) student chapter, and TA'd for [6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/).

## Research
 * From 2017-2018, I worked in the [Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) with Professor Russ Tedrake. I worked on constrained footstep planning through the use of mixed-integer convex optimization, implementing a footstep optimizer with the [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) framework [here](https://github.com/rahulyesantharao/drake-new-code).
 * From 2019-2021, I worked with Leonhard Spiegelberg under Professors Tim Kraska and Malte Schwarzkopf on [Tuplex](http://tuplex.cs.brown.edu/) - open source [here](https://github.com/tuplex/tuplex).
    * In 2020-2021, I pursued this research as a [SuperUROP](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/rahul-yesantharao/) under the MIT EECS Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scholar grant.
    * In June 2021, we published this work in [SIGMOD '21](https://2021.sigmod.org/) - see the paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3457244).
    * At [SIGMOD '22 Reproducibility](https://reproducibility.sigmod.org/reports.html), Tuplex received all the reproducibility badges - see the report [here](https://reproducibility.sigmod.org/rep_rep/2022/Lehner-SIGMODReproReport16.pdf).
 * In 2021-2022, I did my MEng research with Professor Julian Shun, working on parallel, batch-dynamic kd-trees.
    * I wrote my [thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/143277) and a condensed [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06188) based on this work.
    * We also published this work in [ESA 2022](https://algo2022.eu/esa/) as part of the larger ParGeo framework - see the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2022.88).

## Internships

I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, just a couple minutes away from the Johnson Space Center. I graduated from Clear Lake High School as Salutatorian of the Class of 2017. During my time in high school, I was invited to the White House Science Fair in 2015 and 2016. I also competed in the USA Math and Computing Olympiads. In addition, I was the principal cellist of the [CLHS Orchestra](http://lakeorchestra.org/) and played in the Texas All State Orchestras (2015, [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWuUI1-IBZ8), [20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGhqUWLgGeM)[17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCT5MtY9xtw)).
