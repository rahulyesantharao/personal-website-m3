Hi! I’m Rahul. I'm a senior/first-semester MEng student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying Course 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). During my time at MIT, I have directed DevOps for [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org) and helped run the [MIT IEEE/ACM](http://ieeeacm.mit.edu/) student chapter.

## Research
 * From 2017-2018, I worked in the [Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) with Professor Russ Tedrake. I worked on constrained footstep planning through the use of mixed-integer convex optimization, implementing a footstep optimizer with the [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) framework [here](https://github.com/rahulyesantharao/drake-new-code).
 * Since 2019, I have been doing research with Professors Tim Kraska and Malte Schwarzkopf, working on [Tuplex](http://tuplex.cs.brown.edu/).
    * In 2021, I am pursuing this research as a [SuperUROP](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/rahul-yesantharao/) under the MIT EECS Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scholar grant.
 * I am also currently doing my MEng research with Professor Julian Shun, working on parallel data structures.

## Work
 * Summer 2018: SWE intern on the infrastructure team at [Quora](https://www.quora.com)
 * Summer 2019: SWE intern on the marketdata and tools/compilers teams at [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com)
 * Summer 2020: FPGA intern on the hardware team at [Akuna Capital](https://akunacapital.com/)
 * Winter 2021: FPGA intern at [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com)

I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, just a couple minutes away from the Johnson Space Center. I graduated from Clear Lake High School as Salutatorian of the Class of 2017. During my time in high school, I was invited to the White House Science Fair in 2015 and 2016. I also competed in the USA Math and Computing Olympiads. In addition, I was the principal cellist of the [CLHS Orchestra](http://lakeorchestra.org/) and played in the Texas All State Orchestras (2015, [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWuUI1-IBZ8), [20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGhqUWLgGeM)[17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCT5MtY9xtw)).
