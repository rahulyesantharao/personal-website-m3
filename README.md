Yet another personal website rebuild - completely static this time!

TODO:

 - [ ] index.html cache busting
 - [ ] open markdown links in new tab - custom extension
 - [ ] facebook, twitter meta tags
 - [ ] site analytics
 - [ ] run benchmarks to compare old and new sites
 - [ ] write a blog post about it
